## Review

_Congratulations! You've successfully modernized Mergington High School's legacy accounting system and brought it into the modern era!_

Here's a recap of your key accomplishments:

- **Analyzed legacy COBOL code** using GitHub Copilot Chat to understand business logic
- **Generated documentation** (Mermaid data flow diagrams and test plans) with Copilot
- **Modernized the codebase** from COBOL to Node.js using Copilot's code transformation capabilities
- **Created comprehensive unit tests** based on the generated test plan

The school's administration is thrilled with the results! The new system is not only easier to maintain but provides better service to students, parents, and staff. The IT team can now quickly implement new features as school needs evolve, and the integration with other school systems has dramatically reduced administrative workload.
